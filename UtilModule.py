# By default, the allowed chars is string.printable (see https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#string-constants for string constants).
# If a char is both allowed and disallowed, disallowed has higher importance.
# If allowed_chars is None, all chars are allowed (unless those specified in disallowed_chars).
